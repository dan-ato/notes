# notes
This is the start of my .. Digital .. Engineering Codex ..
In an effort to get more familiar with the GitHub interface, 
as well as to begin formalizing and structuring my technical inclinations, and investigations,
I will be adding any pertinent notes here 
as I develop my understanding of electrical and engineering concepts.
I will be expressing any tangential knowledge or notices spurred in the process,
perhaps on a whim-like basis, or in contrast, perhaps more deliberate and intentful. 

Here is a prospective table of contents (at least to start). 
If things change, so will this table of contents.
