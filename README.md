# notes
This is the start of my very own "engineering codex":
a growing collection of notes, concepts, and... notes on concepts
as I journey through Electrical Engineering, DIY, and applied systems thinking. 

## purpose

In an effort to get more familiar with the GitHub interface, 
as well as to begin formalizing and structuring my technical inclinations and investigations,
I will be adding any pertinent notes here in a categorized system
as I develop my understanding of electrical, computer, and engineering concepts.

If you find anything useful, feel free to fork, adapt, or contribute.
